# PYTHON COURSE

## Python Built-in Functions
- The print() function is the equivalent to console.log() for JS. It prints output to the console. Using \n prints output on a new line.
- The input() function prompts a user to enter some data. It is used in conjunction with the print function to perform I/O tasks.
- len() returns the length of a string.
- type() returns the type of the data.
- str() typecasts other data types to a string.
- int() typecasts other data types to an integer.
- float() typecasts other data types to a float.
- round() rounds down a float to a specified number of decimal places. It takes the number, and the desired number of decimal places as arguments. E.g. `round(2.5636222, 2)` returns 2.56.

## Variables
The naming convention for python variables uses lowercase separated by underscores, in contrast with JS which uses camel casing.

## Data Types
- Primitive Types: Primitive types are String, Integer, Float and Boolean. Indexing of strings is known as `subscripting`.

## Math Operations
Mathematical operations are basically the same as in JS. 
- A unique operator is the floor division operator `//` which gives the quotient of a division operation. E.g. `4.5 // 2` returns 4 as the quotient.
- f-Strings provide the same functionality as string literals in Javascript. A string can contain variables by simply prepending an f to the string.
